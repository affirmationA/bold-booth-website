# ✅ Display Fix Complete - Bold Booth Site

## Problem Solved ✨

The deployed site was showing incorrectly due to aggressive CSS overrides that were conflicting with the base styles and causing layout problems.

## Solution Implemented

### 🗑️ Removed Problematic File
**Deleted:** `css/size-reduction.css`
- This file contained `!important` overrides that were too aggressive
- Was causing layout breaks, cramped spacing, and readability issues
- Removed completely to restore clean layout

### ✅ Current Site Configuration

**Active CSS Files:**
1. `css/style.css` - Main stylesheet with optimized, balanced sizing
2. `css/game-screenshots.css` - Game gallery specific styles

**Typography (Optimized):**
- Base font-size: **15px** (excellent readability)
- Body font-size: **0.95rem**
- Line-height: **1.55** (optimal reading comfort)

**Layout (Professional):**
- Container max-width: **1000px** (focused content)
- Navigation height: **70px** (clean, professional)
- Logo height: **40px** (well-proportioned)

**Spacing (Balanced - 75% of original):**
- 2xs: 0.25rem | xs: 0.375rem | sm: 0.75rem | md: 1.125rem
- lg: 1.5rem | xl: 2.25rem | 2xl: 3rem | 3xl: 4.5rem | 4xl: 6rem

**Images (Consistent Hierarchy):**
- **Scoreboard Display:** 900px (largest - the big screen experience)
- **Booth Interface:** 350px (medium - the recording station)
- **Game Screenshots:** 900px container, responsive grid

### 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Too aggressive size reduction (50% everywhere)

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Balanced, professional sizing
- ✅ Excellent readability (15px base)
- ✅ Natural spacing (75% reduction, not 50%)
- ✅ No CSS conflicts
- ✅ Clean, modern layout
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
